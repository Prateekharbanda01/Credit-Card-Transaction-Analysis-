Credit Card Spending Habits Analysis using MySQL and MS Excel 

The project focused on analyzing consumer behavior and spending patterns, particularly in relation to credit card transactions in India. Using SQL and Excel, I conducted a detailed exploration of multidimensional transaction data, delving into variables such as gender, city, and other relevant factors to discern consumer trends and interests. This involved identifying various card and expense type combinations through "Multidimensional Transaction Analysis." Additionally, I employed advanced analytical techniques, including Functions, Joins, Group & Order by, CTE (Common Table Expressions), union, union all, and Window functions, to extract meaningful insights from the data. The aim was to gain a comprehensive understanding of purchasing behavior and provide actionable insights for decision-making in the credit card industry.

Used advanced analytical techniques: 

including Aggregation Functions, 
Joins, 
Group & Order by,
